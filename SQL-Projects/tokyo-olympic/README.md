# Tokyo Olympics 2021 Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes data from the Tokyo Olympics 2021 using SQL queries to extract insights about athletes, their nationalities, and sport disciplines. The dataset includes information about 11,000 athletes who participated in the event. The project demonstrates skills in SQL table creation, data loading, and query writing to answer specific analytical questions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains details about Tokyo Olympics athletes and is stored in a CSV file (`data/athletes.csv`). The structure of the `athletes` table is as follows:

| Column Name  | Type         | Description         |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| name         | VARCHAR(255) | Athlete's name      |
| nationality  | VARCHAR(255) | Athlete's nationality |
| discipline   | VARCHAR(255) | Sport discipline    |

**Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size or privacy constraints. Users can obtain the dataset from [source, if applicable] or use a CSV file with the same structure.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**: Ensure MySQL is installed on your system. Alternatively, use a compatible SQL database.
2. **Set Up DataGrip (Optional)**: This project was tested with DataGrip, but any SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) will work.
3. **Enable `local_infile`**:
   - In MySQL, run: `SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;`
   - In DataGrip, add `allowLoadLocalInfile=true` to the connection URL (e.g., `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tokyo_olympics?allowLoadLocalInfile=true`).
4. **Create Database**: Create a database (e.g., `tokyo_olympics`) in your SQL client.
5. **Prepare Data**: Place the `athletes.csv` file in the specified path (e.g., `~/Data_Analysis_with_SQL/SQL-Projects/tokyo-olympic/data/athletes.csv`) or update the path in `queries.sql`.
6. **Run the SQL Script**: Execute the `queries.sql` file in your SQL client to:
   - Create the `athletes` table.
   - Load data from the CSV file.
   - Run analytical queries.

## Objectives
The project involves writing SQL queries to achieve the following outputs:

1. **Query 1: Iranian Athletes**
   - Retrieve the names of Iranian athletes (nationality: `Islamic Republic of Iran`), sorted in ascending order by name.
2. **Query 2: Discipline and Country Counts**
   - Return the disciplines for each country, along with the country name and the number of participants in that discipline. The output includes three columns: `discipline`, `nationality`, and `count`, sorted in descending order by `count`.
3. **Query 3: Country Ranking**
   - Predict the ranking of countries based on the number of participants. The output includes two columns: `nationality` and `count`, sorted in descending order by `count`.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries are provided in [queries.sql](queries.sql). The file includes:
- Table creation for `athletes`.
- Data loading from `athletes.csv` using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.
- Three analytical queries addressing the objectives above.

## Results
Sample outputs for the queries are not included in this repository but can be generated by running `queries.sql`. Example results might look like:

### Query 1: Iranian Athletes
| name              |
|-------------------|
| Ali Rezaei        |
| Sara Bahrami      |

### Query 2: Discipline and Country Counts
| discipline | nationality | count |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Swimming   | USA         | 150   |
| Athletics  | Japan       | 120   |

### Query 3: Country Ranking
| nationality | count |
|-------------|-------|
| USA         | 600   |
| Japan       | 450   |

## Notes
- Ensure the CSV file path in `queries.sql` matches the location of your `athletes.csv`.
- If you encounter errors with `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, verify that `local_infile` is enabled on both the MySQL server and client.
- The project assumes the CSV file has a header row, which is skipped during data loading (`IGNORE 1 LINES`).
